AppointmentProgram
==================

Program that serves as a dairy. It stores appointments
It is written in Java.
I used a sparse table as the data structure for storing the appointments while serialization is used to store for persistency i.e even after the program is closed appointments wont be lost..
Serialization was also used to save persistence data for later use of the program.
This is just the foundation of the program. Contains the basic operations like storing,deleting and updating the appointments.
Am new to gitHub so i dont know how to upload a netbeans project but the classes(.java files) can be packaged in Netbeans or Eclipse and it should work.
Suggestions and tips on how to upload a netbeans project on github, would be well appreciated.
If there are any challenges while trying to make this code work pls let me be notified.
The MAIN Class is in the Diary Class. The program can start running from there.
Contributions Please!!!!!!!
